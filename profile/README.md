# Open Source powers JPMorgan Chase

## Welcome to our project repos

Here you will find JPMC open source projects that our developers have incubated and brought to the open source community.

### What we do

JPMC has a long history of building successful open source projects, forging open standards, and contributing to the open source community at large. 

From [Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMPQ)](https://www.amqp.org/) (an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organization), to more recently [Quorum](https://consensys.net/quorum/products/) (an open-source protocol layer that enables enterprises to leverage Ethereum for their private or public production blockchain applications,  acquired by ConsenSys in Aug-2020), we are committed to open source.
