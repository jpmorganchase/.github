# Open Source powers JPMorgan Chase

## Welcome to our project repos

Here you will find JPMC open source projects that our developers have incubated and brought to the open source community. 

JPMC has a long history of building sucessful open source projects and open standards, and contributions to the  open source community at large. 

From [Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMPQ)](https://www.amqp.org/)- an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organization, and more recently [Quorum](https://consensys.net/quorum/products/) - an open-source protocol layer that enables enterprises to leverage Ethereum for their private or public production blockchain applications (acquired by ConsenSys in Aug-2020)

At our GitHub here you will find our most recent projects and a pipeline to bring more to the community.

As a FINOS platinum member we have contributed projects to FINOS such as [Perspective](https://github.com/finos/perspective) (an interactive analytics and data visualization component, which is especially well-suited for large and/or streaming datasets) We are maintains and contributors in [FINOS Projects](https://landscape.finos.org/), and FINOS board members.

We welcome contributors!
